# cmusfehme
CMus artwork displayer. Displays a slideshow of artwork in folder of track being played by cmus.

This will attempt to discover if there are any attached displays and if it finds one
it will use that dipslay to create a slideshow of the artwork in the current track's folder
and display it fullscreen on the attached dispaly.

Great for parties of if you are bored like I was. 


# Usage
In cmus do:

:set status_display_program=/home/bubonic/.cmus/fehme.sh

and that's all.

## Optional
You may set the variable FULLSCREEEN in fehme.sh to display the artwork on the primary dispaly in fullscreen mode.
This is good if you don't have an attached display. 

# Enjoy!
